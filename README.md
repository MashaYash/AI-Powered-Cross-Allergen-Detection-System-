About the Project

AllergyGenie is an AI-powered application developed to support individuals in managing food and environmental allergies through a digital platform. The project focuses on improving how users understand their allergy-related information, maintain personal health profiles, and access guidance in a simple and interactive way. By combining structured data storage, intuitive user interfaces, and conversational assistance, the system aims to reduce confusion and improve everyday decision-making for allergy patients.

The application is designed using a modular architecture, allowing different components such as user authentication, profile management, medical report analysis, cross-allergen detection, and chatbot assistance to work together seamlessly. Each module is developed with scalability and maintainability in mind, enabling future integration of advanced AI models, medical datasets, and intelligent recommendation mechanisms.

This repository contains implementation artifacts, interface designs, database structures, and supporting code developed as part of an academic final-year project. The work presented here demonstrates core application functionality, system architecture, and design decisions aligned with real-world application development practices.
